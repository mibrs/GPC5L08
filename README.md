# Synthesing of Sound and Music

Materials for session on 29.11.22

## Overview
Today you will learn more about synthesing of sound and music. We will use three tools, all of them are using Cycling'74's MAX at their core. The tools are:
1. MAX/MSP core objects
2. MAX/MSP with BEAT modules (the modules are built with MAX/MSP, but the complexity is hidden and you only see the user interface to change the parameters as frequency, filter settings, and more.
3. Ableton's [Learning Synth](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/). The audio modules used on this website are also created with MAX.
